In this project I developed a news application using the newsapi.org JSON API. Followed the following steps to setup the API:
• Create a new account and register as a developer at https://newsapi.org/register
• Get an API Key to be used for this application.
• In this application I used the top headlines api, for information check the following link https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines
