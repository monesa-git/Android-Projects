In this project I developed a Trivia quiz. This project is composed of three Activities, which include: Main, Trivia, and Stats Activities.

API Details:
• API URL: http://dev.theappsdr.com/apis/trivia_json/index.php.
• Each object in the question array will contain a text element, and a choices element.
The choices element has an array of choice elements (number of choices is
variable).
• There is an answer element which holds the sequence number of the correct answer.
For example, in the above question the answer is the choice containing “GeorgeWashington” which has the sequence number of 1. A question element can alsohave an image element that should be displayed to a user when viewing thequestion. A image element will hold a URL to an image on a remote server.
